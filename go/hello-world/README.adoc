= Building a Simple Go Application

== Use Case

You want to implement typical automation tasks for a Go project. Those tasks include building the source code into a library, running the tests and creating a binary.

== Implementation

The https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go[Go rules for Bazel] provide this kind of functionality. You can use the rules `go_library`, `go_test` and `go_binary`.

== Usage

To build the binary, execute the target of type `go_binary`.
