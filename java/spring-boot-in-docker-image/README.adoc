= Docker Image for a Spring Boot Application

== Use Case

You want to containerize your Spring Boot application. The https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker[Bazel Container Image Rules] help with achieving the task.

== Implementation

The Docker rules provide language-specific macros for generating a distroless image. The rule `java_image` can create an image for a Java-based application. By default this image doesn't not expose any ports. The instructions can be refined with the help of the rule `container_image`. For example you can define a working directory, ports etc.

== Usage

To create the image, execute the `run` task. You should find the image in the Docker registry.
