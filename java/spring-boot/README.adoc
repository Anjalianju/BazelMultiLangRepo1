= Spring Boot Application

== Use Case

Spring Boot is a popular application framework for building microservices. To build the application, you will have to declare necessary external dependencies and create an uberjar or a runnable application.

== Implementation

It's fairly simple to generate a Java binary that declares the necessary compile dependencies. It gets more complex if you want to build an uberjar that contains all dependencies.

== Usage

To produce the JAR file, run the `java_binary` rule named `spring-boot-hello-world`.

----
$ bazel build //:spring-boot-hello-world
----

After building the binary, you can run the application with the generated shell script.

----
$ cd bazel-bin
$ ./spring-boot-hello-world
----
