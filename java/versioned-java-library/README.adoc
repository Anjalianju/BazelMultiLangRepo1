= Versioned Java Library

== Use Case

By default the `java_library` rule doesn't provide a way to attach a version to the produced artifact. It's very common in the Java ecosystem to create a Java library for later distribution e.g. GitHub release or a binary repository. For that purpose, you'll want to attach a version to the JAR file to clearly identify a set a changes.

== Implementation

You can rename an existing file with the help of a `genrule`. The version can be defined as variable and passed to the `genrule`. In this implementation, the `java_library` and `genrule` have been wrapped in a macro so that they can be reuse across multiple modules.

== Usage

To produce the JAR file, run the `java_library` rule named `messenger`.

----
$ bazel build //:messenger
----

The `genrule` attaches the prefix `versioned` to the name.

----
$ bazel build //:versioned-messenger
----
